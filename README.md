## C# based Pac-Man game
As Team 7, we chose a C# based Pac-Man game for our team project. 

## Created by Youjin Li and Aditya Ganti
The project uses the Windows Platform Foundation framework so the game is a desktop application with a
graphical user interface (GUI). The project follows the classic Pac-Man game with one PacMan, four ghosts, pellets, and power-ups.
In case the reader has not played Pac-Man before, Pac-Man is a two-dimensional puzzle
game where the objective is for Pac-Man to consume all of the pellets without losing all three
lives or time running out. That itself does not make the game challenging. To add difficulty,
there are four different coloured ghosts that are trying to stop Pac-Man from collecting all of
the pellets. To fight back, Pac-Man is able to use power-ups scattered around the map that
allows Pac-Man to consume the ghosts and put them in a timeout for a certain period of time.
